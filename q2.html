        <h1>How the Action attribute works</h1>
        <h2>... in my own words</h2>
        <p>The 'action' attribute in an HTML form specifies the destination for the form data when the form is submitted. When a user submits a form, the data is entered into the form and sent to the web page or server location indicated the 'action' attribute. This attribute is crucial for processing the form data, as it determines where the data is sent for further handling, such as storing it in a database, processing user requests, or initiating email dispatches. Without a specified 'action', the form data would have nowhere to go, making the form essentially non-functional.</p>
